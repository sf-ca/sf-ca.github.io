<p><strong>John 8:32 (ESV) — 32</strong> and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:3–5 (ESV) — 3</strong> As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” <strong>4</strong> And Jesus answered them, “See that no one leads you astray. <strong>5</strong> For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:10–12 (ESV) — 10</strong> And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. <strong>11</strong> And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. <strong>12</strong> And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.</p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 4:1–2 (ESV) — 1</strong> Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, <strong>2</strong> through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared,</p>
<p><strong>2 Timothy 4:3–4 (ESV) — 3</strong> For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, <strong>4</strong> and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.</p>
<p><strong>2 Peter 2:1 (ESV) — 1</strong> But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Jude 3 (ESV) — 3</strong> Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.</p>
<p><strong>Jude 18–19 (ESV) — 18</strong> They said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.” <strong>19</strong> It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 2:18 (ESV) — 18</strong> Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 4:2–3 (ESV) — 2</strong> By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, <strong>3</strong> and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already.</p>
<p><strong>2 John 7–9 (ESV) — 7</strong> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. <strong>8</strong> Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. <strong>9</strong> Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p><strong>2 Peter 2:1 (ESV) — 1</strong> But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 2:22–23 (ESV) — 22</strong> Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. <strong>23</strong> No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 22:18–19 (ESV) — 18</strong> I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, <strong>19</strong> and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</p>
<p><strong>2 Peter 3:16 (ESV) — 16</strong> as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.</p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 6:3 (ESV) — 3</strong> If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness,</p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 1:4 (ESV) — 4</strong> nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith.</p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 1:19 (ESV) — 19</strong> holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith,</p>
<p><strong>John 8:44 (ESV) — 44</strong> You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 1:3–4 (ESV) — 3</strong> As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine, <strong>4</strong> nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith.</p>
<p><strong>2 Timothy 2:16–18 (ESV) — 16</strong> But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, <strong>17</strong> and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <strong>18</strong> who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some.</p>
<p><strong>Galatians 5:7–10 (ESV) — 7</strong> You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? <strong>8</strong> This persuasion is not from him who calls you. <strong>9</strong> A little leaven leavens the whole lump. <strong>10</strong> I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is.</p>
<p><strong>Titus 3:10 (ESV) — 10</strong> As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him,</p>
<p><strong>Jude 17–19 (ESV) — 17</strong> But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. <strong>18</strong> They said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.” <strong>19</strong> It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Galatians 1:7–9 (ESV) — 7</strong> not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. <strong>8</strong> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. <strong>9</strong> As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.</p>
<p><strong>Deuteronomy 13:1–18 (ESV) — 1</strong> “If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, <strong>2</strong> and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ which you have not known, ‘and let us serve them,’ <strong>3</strong> you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. For the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God is testing you, to know whether you love the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul. <strong>4</strong> You shall walk after the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and hold fast to him. <strong>5</strong> But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has taught rebellion against the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, to make you leave the way in which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from your midst. <strong>6</strong>”If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or the wife you embrace or your friend who is as your own soul entices you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which neither you nor your fathers have known, <strong>7</strong> some of the gods of the peoples who are around you, whether near you or far off from you, from the one end of the earth to the other, <strong>8</strong> you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him. <strong>9</strong> But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. <strong>10</strong> You shall stone him to death with stones, because he sought to draw you away from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. <strong>11</strong> And all Israel shall hear and fear and never again do any such wickedness as this among you. <strong>12</strong> “If you hear in one of your cities, which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God is giving you to dwell there, <strong>13</strong> that certain worthless fellows have gone out among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which you have not known, <strong>14</strong> then you shall inquire and make search and ask diligently. And behold, if it be true and certain that such an abomination has been done among you, <strong>15</strong> you shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword, devoting it to destruction, all who are in it and its cattle, with the edge of the sword. <strong>16</strong> You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its open square and burn the city and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God. It shall be a heap forever. It shall not be built again. <strong>17</strong> None of the devoted things shall stick to your hand, that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> may turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you mercy and have compassion on you and multiply you, as he swore to your fathers, <strong>18</strong> if you obey the voice of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, keeping all his commandments that I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God.</p>
<p><strong>Jude 3 (ESV) — 3</strong> Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.</p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 1:3 (ESV) — 3</strong> As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine,</p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 1:20 (ESV) — 20</strong> among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>
<p><strong>2 Timothy 2:14–18 (ESV) — 14</strong> Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers. <strong>15</strong> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. <strong>16</strong> But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, <strong>17</strong> and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <strong>18</strong> who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 2:18–19 (ESV) — 18</strong> Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. <strong>19</strong> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us.</p>
<p><strong>Titus 3:10–11 (ESV) — 10</strong> As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him, <strong>11</strong> knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.</p>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 5:5 (ESV) — 5</strong> you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 7:15–16 (ESV) — 15</strong> “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. <strong>16</strong> You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</p>
<p><strong>2 Timothy 3:5–7 (ESV) — 5</strong> having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. <strong>6</strong> For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, <strong>7</strong> always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>2 John 9–10 (ESV) — 9</strong> Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. <strong>10</strong> If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,</p>
<p><strong>Colossians 2:2–10 (ESV) — 2</strong> that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God’s mystery, which is Christ, <strong>3</strong> in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. <strong>4</strong> I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments. <strong>5</strong> For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ. <strong>6</strong> Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, <strong>7</strong> rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving. <strong>8</strong> See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. <strong>9</strong> For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, <strong>10</strong> and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority.</p>
<p><strong>2 Timothy 3:14–17 (ESV) — 14</strong> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it <strong>15</strong> and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. <strong>16</strong> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, <strong>17</strong> that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.</p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 1:18–19 (ESV) — 18</strong> This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, <strong>19</strong> holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith,</p>
<p><strong>2 Peter 1:3–11 (ESV) — 3</strong> His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, <strong>4</strong> by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire. <strong>5</strong> For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, <strong>6</strong> and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, <strong>7</strong> and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. <strong>8</strong> For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <strong>9</strong> For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. <strong>10</strong> Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. <strong>11</strong> For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Jude 18–21 (ESV) — 18</strong> They said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.” <strong>19</strong> It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. <strong>20</strong> But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, <strong>21</strong> keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:12–14 (ESV) — 12</strong> And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. <strong>13</strong> But the one who endures to the end will be saved. <strong>14</strong> And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</p>
<p><strong>2 Timothy 4:1–5 (ESV) — 1</strong> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: <strong>2</strong> preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. <strong>3</strong> For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, <strong>4</strong> and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. <strong>5</strong> As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</p>
